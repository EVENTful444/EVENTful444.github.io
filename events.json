      "DETAILS": "<p>The thematic title of CAFKA.02: Power to the People was chosen to recognize the 100th anniversary of the inception, in Kitchener, of one of the largest publicly owned utilities in the world. The phrase encouraged artists either to make works that responded directly to this history, to take up its democratic connotations, or to simply view public artistic activity as an act of empowerment in itself.</p><p>P2P by artists Rob Gorbet, Susan LK Gorbet (Kitchener) and Matt Gorbet (Toronto) highlighted the ubiquity of the most basic icons of the electric age: the household switch and bulb. Significantly situated at the entrance to City Hall, P2P put the marquee, a now-ubiquitous and iconic tool of corporate communication, into the hands of the general public. By engaging in the everyday unconscious activity of flipping a light switch, P2P allowed citizens to communicate directly, without the oversight of a centralized authority, within a government-owned public space. Literally and figuratively, P2P brought power to the people.</p><p>P2P consisted of two components. The first was a large marquee sign made up of 125 light bulbs suspended beneath the canopy over the main entrance to Kitchener City Hall. The second was a panel of 125 household light switches located in front of the reflecting pool. Each switch controlled a single bulb that could be turned on or off at will.</p><p>As with all forums where there is potential for differences in opinion, the debate around what were \"appropriate\" messages for the citizenry became particularly intense. The dais where the switch panel was located became the site of heated arguments between people of all descriptions (including police), all eager to voice their thoughts, kudos, or objections to the messages displayed, which were often only single words. Others devised and played games with the work, while others still turned the marquee into decorative pattern.</p>",

      "DETAILS": "<p>In the build of up to CAFKA.14 Stephen Litt approached CAFKA about the possibility of working with two derelict houses on David Street in Kitchener. The CAFKA Program Committee brought Shelburne, Ontario artist Don Miller to Kitchener to consider the possiblities. The condemned houses, which were at one time single family homes, had in recent years been converted into rooming houses and had fallen into considerable disrepair. It was immediately clear that we would not be able to develop a project utilizing the buiilding's interiors. An agreement with the developer Stephen Litt allowed CAFKA to appropriate the houses through the end of the 2014 biennial exhibition, after which time the houses would be demolished. Don Miller decided to paint one black and one white, and call the project Saturn and Cronus.</p><p>Don Miller will discuss the genesis of Saturn and Cronus, the process of making it happen and the controversy that attended it. We'll have an opportunity to reflect on what may have accounted for the angry reactions and to assess the fallout.</p>",

      "DETAILS": "<p>�Concord Floral is a million-square-foot abandoned greenhouse and a hangout for neighborhood kids. But something has happened there. Something nobody wants to talk about. This play re-imagines Giovanni Boccaccio's medieval allegory, The Decameron, in a contemporary Canadian suburb, in which ten teens must flee a plague they have brought upon themselves.�</p><p>Written by Jordan Tannahill in 2014, Concord Floral explores themes of alienation, sexuality, dislocation, loneliness and exclusion. All the characters are teenagers. The confusion of growing up is portrayed with sensitivity and openness, but also comments on the collective anxiety and fear that is so rampant in our world today, especially for young people. A menacing tale of vengeance that deals with disaffected suburban teen life honestly and directly, Concord Floral is intelligent, humorous and full of theatrical spectacle.</p><p>Guest director Vikki Anderson (Artistic Director of Theatrefront in Toronto) works with a cast of ten (7 females and 3 males) to create a choral structure, not unlike a Greek chorus, where the actors will stretch their bodies, voices and minds to tell this beautiful and haunting urban legend. The production is book-ended by two engagement events. Doors will open 30 minutes prior to the performance so the audience can engage in an art installation that reflects Concord Floral�s theatrical points of emphasis. In the theatre gallery, spectators are invited to immerse themselves in a thematic display meant to extend the world of the play to the world right in front of us. Following each performance, the audience is invited to participate in a talkback with the cast about the themes and content of the play.</p><p>Theatre of the Arts, Modern Languages Building</p>",

Led by a 26 year old rising jazz-piano star, come see this powerhouse quartet which features internationally acclaimed jazz trumpet iconoclast Brownman Ali alongside some of the top 20-something jazz musicians Canada has to offer. \"Nick Maclean's \"Rites Of Ascension\" is nicely twisted and baked! A fresh look at Herbie Hancock classics and delicious new original themes all presented with taste and virtuosity. No safety net here, everyone is living on the edge. Nick's playing and writing is sublime, Brownman sounds ferocious and the rhythm section is an unstoppable force. This is truly jazz at it's adventurous best. I love the music these guys make. You will too.\" -- Bruce Cassidy, Blood Sweat &amp; Tears alumni, EVI world authority FROM THE LINER NOTES BY DAVE RESTIVO \"Pianist and composer Nick Malcean, 26 years old at the time of this recording, is in very much the spirit of Hancock, which is to say that this album is very much about Maclean's artistic voice (and those of his carefully chosen colleagues)... inspired by Hancock while also presenting a highly individual and distinct evolution from the source material.\" - Dave Restivo, Canadian Jazz Giant</p><p>&nbsp;BUY THE ALBUM: https://nickmacleanquartet.bandcamp.com/ (Releases October 31st)</p><p>About NICK MACLEAN QUARTET www.NicholasMaclean.com/nickmacleanquartet</p><p>This contemplative and often thrilling quartet's explorations of modern, original repertoire is led by a fast-rising star in Toronto's jazz piano community, 25 year old NICK MACLEAN. Formed in 2016, Maclean's foursome delivers jazz between the two poles of thoughtful introspection and powerhouse conveyance, taking influences from Herbie Hancock's primordial 1960's Blue Note era recordings, while paying tribute to some of the greatest improvisers in jazz history. Repeatedly regarded as a modern take on the ferocious and hard-swinging post-bop era, the group has been busy in the Ontario jazz club circuit and featured in numerous festivals and concert series including multiple appearances at the Toronto Jazz Festival both as a featured ensemble and an often requested backing band. In addition to their original material, the ensemble has also mounted several popular tribute series to jazz masters including Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard, Clark Terry &amp; Cole Porter. The group is frequently lauded for the strength of their collective improvisatory vision and features one of Canada's most provocative improvising trumpet-playing iconoclasts Brownman Ali, standing shoulder to shoulder with Maclean &amp; two of Toronto's top-tier rhythm section 20-somethings: Jesse Dietschi on bass and Tyler Goertzen on drums. The synergy of the 4 is always palpable in concert. The quartet's debut 11-track full-length album \"Rites Of Ascension\" features 6 Maclean-penned compositions, 1 Brownman original and 4 re-imagined Herbie Hancock classics, all recorded at the renowned Canterbury Studios in Toronto. Produced by Brownman Ali, this new release will be available on Browntasauras Records internationally in the fall of 2017.</p><p>About BROWNMAN and BROWNTASAURAS www.Brownman.com | www.Browntasauras.com</p><p>Trinidadian-born, NYC-schooled &amp; heralded as &ldquo;Canada&rsquo;s preeminent Jazz trumpeter&rdquo; by NYC&rsquo;s Village Voice, multi-award winning trumpet player Brownman Ali stands at the forefront of innovation in the Canadian jazz community.

      "DETAILS": "<p>CAFKA is pleased to announce that Gorbet Design artists Robert Gorbet, Susan LK Gorbet, and Matt Gorbet will be the third and last speakers in the 2017 CAFKA Rewind speakers' series at the Waterloo Public Library on Monday, November 20 at 7 PM.</p><p>The thematic title of CAFKA.02: Power to the People was chosen to recognize the 100th anniversary of the inception, in Kitchener, of one of the largest publicly owned utilities in the world. The phrase encouraged artists either to make works that responded directly to this history, to take up its democratic connotations, or to simply view public artistic activity as an act of empowerment in itself.</p><p>P2P by artists Rob Gorbet, Susan LK Gorbet (Kitchener)&nbsp;and Matt Gorbet (Toronto) highlighted the ubiquity of the most basic icons of the electric age: the household switch and bulb. Significantly situated at the entrance to City Hall, P2P put the marquee, a now-ubiquitous and iconic tool of corporate communication, into the hands of the general public. By engaging in the everyday unconscious activity of flipping a light switch, P2P allowed citizens to communicate directly, without the oversight of a centralized authority, within a government-owned public space. Literally and figuratively, P2P brought power to the people.</p><p>P2P consisted of two components. The first was a large marquee sign made up of 125 light bulbs suspended beneath the canopy over the main entrance to Kitchener City Hall. The second was a panel of 125 household light switches located in front of the reflecting pool. Each switch controlled a single bulb that could be turned on or off at will.</p><p>The work was reminiscent of a celebratory marquee that spanned Kitchener's King Street in 1910 in which the words �Hydro� and �For the People� were spelled out in light bulbs. The difference here was that the message was not fixed. Available 24 hours a day for the duration of the Forum, anyone could arrange the lit bulbs to spell out personal messages. &nbsp;</p><p>As with all forums where there is potential for differences in opinion, the debate around what were \"appropriate\" messages for the citizenry became particularly intense. The dais where the switch panel was located became the site of heated arguments between people of all descriptions (including police), all eager to voice their thoughts, kudos, or objections to the messages displayed, which were often only single words. Others devised and played games with the work, while others still turned the marquee into decorative pattern.</p><p>The team behind P2P is a design collective dedicated to enriching the lives of citizens through the creative application of technology. Collectively, they hold several patents and have research affiliations with the University of Waterloo, MIT, Stanford, Interval Research, Xerox PARC, and Silicon Graphics. Their work has been shown in the USA, Sweden, Austria, and Japan.</p><p>Text by Andrew Wright.</p><p>CAFKA Rewind is a series of artist talks with a difference. Our guest speakers are familiar figures: They have each exhibited work with CAFKA over the course of our 16-year history. Many in the Region have not only seen their work, a lot of us also helped make them happen. Some of these projects drew criticism in the community and the subsequent controversies sometimes involved the local media and municipal governments. CAFKA Rewind goes over some of this familiar territory. We want to examine how the projects were developed, explore the nature of the disagreements within the community and reflect on how we have changed in the years since.</p><p>CAFKA Rewind has been made possible with the support of the City of Waterloo.</p>",

      "DETAILS": "<p>On November 22 and 25, The Nota Bene Baroque Players will present a special multimedia concert, celebrating the Grand River, our region�s historic waterway at Wesley United Church.</p><p>By exploring the Grand River in words, images, and music we come to realize that rivers all over the planet have much in common. Marianne Brandis, author of The Grand River, reads passages reflecting on rivers in general and on the Grand in particular, while Gerard Brender &agrave; Brandis�s wood engravings of scenes along the river, most of which appear in the book, will be on display. Nota Bene Baroque Players will perform music written by Baroque composers inspired by water, including works by Handel, Telemann, and Vivaldi. Original engravings, and copies of the book, will be available for purchase at the concert.</p><p>Of special interest will be the performance of a new composition, Bottlenecked, by collaborative Canadian composers Spy D&eacute;nomm&eacute;-Welch &amp; Catherine Magowan. Their work tells the story of the journey of a drop of water from its source to its final destination. The title of this new work alludes to the many possible economic and political issues currently surrounding water on both a local and global scale, including its protection, conservation, consumption, and control. In presenting this performance art event, Nota Bene Baroque Players strive to foster a greater appreciation of the Grand River and its ecosystem. We also view this concert as an opportunity to reflect on issues surrounding water security which are currently under intense discussion, both in our region and globally.</p><p>The NBBP gratefully acknowledges the kind support of the Region of Waterloo Arts Fund 15/150 Grant for this concert.</p><p>TICKETS INDIVIDUAL: $30 SENIOR: $25 All Students FREE (with ID)</p><p>By&nbsp;phone or order online &nbsp;Advance Ticket Reservations by email.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tickets purchased by phone or online will be available for pickup at the box office at the time of performance.</p><p>In person:&nbsp;Ticket purchase available at the door (cash or cheque only - subject to availability)</p><p>Advance ticket purchase from&nbsp;Words Worth Books (96 King Street South, Waterloo, ON)</p>",

      "DETAILS": "<p>On November 22 and 25, The Nota Bene Baroque Players will present a special multimedia concert, celebrating the Grand River, our region�s historic waterway at the Calvary United Church.</p><p>By exploring the Grand River in words, images, and music we come to realize that rivers all over the planet have much in common. Marianne Brandis, author of The Grand River, reads passages reflecting on rivers in general and on the Grand in particular, while Gerard Brender &agrave; Brandis�s wood engravings of scenes along the river, most of which appear in the book, will be on display. Nota Bene Baroque Players will perform music written by Baroque composers inspired by water, including works by Handel, Telemann, and Vivaldi. Original engravings, and copies of the book, will be available for purchase at the concert.</p><p>Of special interest will be the performance of a new composition, Bottlenecked, by collaborative Canadian composers Spy D&eacute;nomm&eacute;-Welch &amp; Catherine Magowan. Their work tells the story of the journey of a drop of water from its source to its final destination. The title of this new work alludes to the many possible economic and political issues currently surrounding water on both a local and global scale, including its protection, conservation, consumption, and control. In presenting this performance art event, Nota Bene Baroque Players strive to foster a greater appreciation of the Grand River and its ecosystem. We also view this concert as an opportunity to reflect on issues surrounding water security which are currently under intense discussion, both in our region and globally.</p><p>The NBBP gratefully acknowledges the kind support of the Region of Waterloo Arts Fund 15/150 Grant for this concert.</p><p>TICKETS INDIVIDUAL: $30 SENIOR: $25 All Students FREE (with ID)</p><p>By&nbsp;phone or order online &nbsp;Advance Ticket Reservations by email.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tickets purchased by phone or online will be available for pickup at the box office at the time of performance.</p><p>In person:&nbsp;Ticket purchase available at the door (cash or cheque only - subject to availability)</p><p>Advance ticket purchase from&nbsp;Words Worth Books (96 King Street South, Waterloo, ON)</p>",

      "DETAILS": "<p>Paddy Johnson is the founding Editor of Art F City and maintains a column on digital art for Artnet. In addition to her work on the blog, she has been published in magazines such as New York Magazine, The New York Times and The Economist. Paddy lectures widely about art and the Internet at venues including Yale University, Parsons, Rutgers, South by Southwest, and the Whitney Independent Study Program. In 2007, she received a scholarship to attend iCommons conference in Croatia as the art critic. In 2008, she served on the board of the Rockefeller Foundation New Media Fellowships and became the first blogger to earn a Creative Capital Arts Writers grant from the Creative Capital Foundation. Paddy was nominated for best art critic at The Rob Pruitt Art Awards in 2010 and 2013. In 2014, she was the subject of a VICE profile for her work as an independent art blogger.</p><p>Born in Guelph, Ontario, Johnson was educated at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick and at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Johnson began the blog Art F City in 2005 and has earned a reputation for not \"pulling punches\" -- part of its mandate of \"blunt criticism, commentary and community-minded journalism.\"</p><p>*** The Musagetes Foundation is concerned with the role the arts can play in addressing the faultlines of modern society. Musagetes is a hub for activist interventions that advance the role of the arts in modern life. It operates mainly by convening � by creating living experiences, some small, some large, that bring people together to articulate social needs, generate ideas and spark action. CAFKA initiates conversations around public space and the social and critical functions of art.</p><p>CAFKA's programming seeks resonance and support in the community where issues of ecology, marginalized communities, cultural participation, technology and urban life overlap with the issues addressed by contemporary artists. Together, Musagetes and CAFKA are partners and co-producers of the Big Ideas in Art and Culture lecture series.</p>",

Six Months with the Barefoot Grandmamas, Waterloo No Problem! Six Months with the Barefoot Grandmamas tells the story of a rural solar electrification project run by the Barefoot College in the Tilonia village, Rajasthan state, India. Here, numerous illiterate rural women from all over the world, particularly Africa, are being trained as solar engineers. The project symbolizes hope, showing how a simple idea, originating from a village in India has the potential to impact global communities. The film follows the story of a group of African women from Tanzania, South Sudan, Malawi, and Liberia, living, and learning together for six months in Tilonia �having left their families and countries for the first time in their lives. They are unable to speak the same language, but share a unifying goal: to become solar engineers and bring electricity to their villages, which had never had light. Through the stories of these women, a fascinating tale of sustainability and social inclusion unfolds.</p>",

This hotel is more than just a business: it�s the hub of the community, and Aline knows that closing the establishment would deal this small town a major blow.

      "DETAILS": "<p>Marshall is a member of Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug. Her art practice focuses on the art of ancestral storytelling � creating an intersection where viewers can meet to understand the essence of relationships, connection/disconnection, and loss. Through the making and documentation of seven jingle dresses, Marshall explores the stories that have shaped her perception of the complexities of her family history in the context of Canadian history. The social inequities, resistance and sadness told in these narratives serves as a springboard to examine the act of healing, compassion and forgiveness.</p><p>Location: Robert Langen Art Gallery</p>",

      "DETAILS": "<p>Hear from award-winning business journalist Amanda Lang as she examines how to embrace discomfort, and use it to your advantage.</p><p>About Amanda Lang's book, \"The Beauty of Discomfort\": Why do some people drive change while others are blindsided by it? Why are some people able to adapt and thrive? How can we make change easier? Truly successful people don�t merely tolerate discomfort�they embrace it and seek it out again and again. Business founders and university students, top athletes and couch potatoes, meditation gurus and military leaders all have very different ways of coping with discomfort, but the most successful among them believe that withstanding discomfort is a skill that has helped them in hugely positive ways. Some degree of discomfort is inherently good for you. It can spur you on, pushing you to test your own limits. Learning to tolerate, and then embrace, discomfort is the foundation for change, for individuals and businesses alike. Becoming comfortable with discomfort won�t just make us more resilient and more successful, however we define success. It will also make us happier.</p><p>About Amanda Lang: Amanda Lang has been covering business in North America for 20 years. Currently, Lang is anchor at the BNN, Bloomberg and CTV News Network. Previously, she was an anchor for CBC News, The National, and host of The Exchange with Amanda Lang. She also hosted The Lang and O�Leary Exchange, with Kevin O�Leary.</p><p>Guests will be given an opportunity to have their book signed by Amanda Lang. The Bookshelf will be on site selling copies of Lang's book, \"The Beauty of Discomfort.\"</p><p>Please register for your free tickets online.</p><p>Location: University of Guelph's Athletic Centre</p>",

      "DETAILS": "<p>UpStart is a bi-annual one-act play festival that presents works that have been written, directed and acted by students under faculty supervision. Our three works this year are:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;\">Hamlet Reworked adapted and performed by Gareth Potter<br /><br /></span><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;\">The Game of String written by alumna Jenn Addesso<br /><br />Hopscotch written by Joanna Cleary<br /><br /><br />The performance will begin in the lobby of the Modern Languages building at 7:30pm with the first of three installments by Gareth Potter as Hamlet in Hamlet Reworked. Set outside the traditional performance space, this solo presentation of a classic text reworked explores mortality, grief, and the nature of live theatre. By deconstructing and reassembling Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet in a personal manner, what more can we learn about Shakespeare&rsquo;s most famous play? The second installment will occur during intermission in the lobby, with the final installment closing the evening onstage.<br /><br />Following his performance, the audience will move into the theatre for director Brooke Barnes&rsquo; production of The Game of String. The Game of String explores the relationship between how we curate ourselves on social media and who we are in reality. In the digital world, we find ourselves in competition with others. When we die, is the digital persona we leave behind authentic to who we really were?<br /><br />Our second mainstage offering is, Hopscotch, directed by Rebecca Reid. Losing herself to the afterlife, Eva and her childhood friend, Chloe, revisit their shared past and fight to keep memories of one another alive. Through honesty, pain, love, and hopscotch, they learn what it means to truly remember. <br /><br />Originally an extracurricular event completely produced by students, the Theatre and Performance programme took over producing the bi-annual event in 2016 bringing the event to the mainstage and increasing both the mentorship opportunities for students and the production values.<br /><br />Join us for an evening of innovation and do not miss the world premieres of these works as we explore themes of reflection and connection. Please note that the performances include mature themes for ages 12+.<br /><br /><br />Location: Theatre of the Arts, Modern Languages Building<br /><br />Tickets (assigned seating)<br /><br />$15 General; $10 Students &amp; Seniors; $5 eyeGO<br /><br />Call our Box Office: or visit our website.</span></p><p><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;\">Follow us on Twitter and Instagram @UWTheatrePerf #UWUpstart18<br /><br />Like us on Facebook at </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UWTheatrePerf\"><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;\">https://www.facebook.com/UWTheatrePerf</span></a></p>",
